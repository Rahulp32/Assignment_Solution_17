    "### **Q1. What is an API? Give an Example**\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Definition:**\n",
    "An **API (Application Programming Interface)** is a set of rules and protocols that allows different software applications to communicate with each other. APIs enable developers to interact with external systems or services without knowing their internal implementation.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Real-Life Example:**\n",
    "- **Weather Applications**: Mobile apps use APIs to fetch real-time weather data from external services like OpenWeatherMap or WeatherStack.\n",
    "  - Example: A weather app sends a request to the weather API with the location and gets a response containing temperature, humidity, and forecast.\n"

    "### **Q2. Advantages and Disadvantages of Using API**\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Advantages:**\n",
    "1. **Simplified Integration**:\n",
    "   - APIs provide predefined methods, making it easier to integrate systems.\n",
    "2. **Automation**:\n",
    "   - APIs enable automation of repetitive tasks, reducing manual effort.\n",
    "3. **Scalability**:\n",
    "   - APIs allow systems to scale by leveraging external services.\n",
    "4. **Data Sharing**:\n",
    "   - APIs enable secure and controlled data sharing between applications.\n",
    "5. **Standardization**:\n",
    "   - APIs follow consistent protocols, ensuring uniformity in communication.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Disadvantages:**\n",
    "1. **Security Risks**:\n",
    "   - APIs can expose sensitive data if not properly secured.\n",
    "2. **Dependency**:\n",
    "   - Applications relying on external APIs may face downtime if the API provider is unavailable.\n",
    "3. **Complexity**:\n",
    "   - Designing and maintaining APIs can be complex.\n",
    "4. **Performance Issues**:\n",
    "   - Excessive API calls can lead to slower performance.\n",

    "### **Q4. Explain REST and SOAP Architecture. Mention Shortcomings of SOAP**\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **REST (Representational State Transfer):**\n",
    "- REST is an architectural style for designing networked applications.\n",
    "- It uses standard HTTP methods like `GET`, `POST`, `PUT`, and `DELETE`.\n",
    "- Data is usually exchanged in JSON or XML format.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Features:**\n",
    "1. Stateless: Each request is independent and contains all necessary information.\n",
    "2. Cacheable: Responses can be cached for better performance.\n",
    "3. Uniform Interface: Standardized URLs and HTTP methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **SOAP (Simple Object Access Protocol):**\n",
    "- SOAP is a protocol for exchanging structured information in web services.\n",
    "- It uses XML for message formatting and relies on application layer protocols like HTTP and SMTP.\n",
